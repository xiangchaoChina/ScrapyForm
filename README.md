<h1>Scrapy Form Application</h1>
since the windows platform does not have the application to manage the spider ,so i just write a simple .net from application to handle this spider system . 

<br>
before you try to use form applicaton ,please make sure you have already install .net framework 4.0 , then you should install Mysql database,and init the sql database ,init the table . enjoy :)
